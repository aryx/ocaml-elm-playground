Start by putting shapes on screen and work up to making games. I hope this package will be fun for a broad range of ages and backgrounds!</p><h3 id="pictures"><a href="#pictures" class="anchor"></a>Pictures</h3><p>A picture is a list of shapes. For example, this picture combines a brown rectangle and a green circle to make a tree</p><pre class="language-ocaml"><code>open Playground

let app =
  picture [
    rectangle brown 40. 200.;
    circle green 100.
      |&gt; move_up 100.;
  ]

let main = Playground_platform.run_app app</code></pre><p>Play around to get familiar with all the different <a href="Playground/index.html#shapes" title="shapes">shapes</a> and <a href="Playground/index.html#transformations" title="transformations">transformations</a> in the library.</p><h3 id="animations"><a href="#animations" class="anchor"></a>Animations</h3><p>An animation is a list of shapes that changes over time. For example, here is a spinning triangle:</p><pre class="language-ocaml"><code>open Playground

let view time = [ 
   triangle orange 50.
      |&gt; rotate (spin 8. time);
  ]

let app = animation view

let main = Playground_platform.run_app app</code></pre><p>It will do a full spin every 8 seconds.</p><p>Maybe try making a car with spinning octogons as wheels? Try using <a href="Playground/index.html#val-wave"><code>Playground.wave</code></a> to move things back-and-forth? Try using <a href="Playground/index.html#val-zigzag"><code>Playground.zigzag</code></a> to fade things in-and-out?</p><h3 id="games"><a href="#games" class="anchor"></a>Games</h3><p>A game lets you use input from the mouse and keyboard to change your picture. For example, here is a square that moves around based on the arrow keys:</p><pre class="language-ocaml"><code>open Playground

let view _computer (x, y) = [ 
  square blue 40.
   |&gt; move x y
 ]

let update computer (x, y) =
  (x +. to_x computer.keyboard, y +. to_y computer.keyboard)

let app = 
  game view update (0., 0.)

let main = Playground_platform.run_app app</code></pre><p>Every game has three important parts:</p><ol><li><code>memory</code> - Store information. Our example stores <code>(x,y)</code> coordinates.</li><li><code>update</code> - Update the memory based on mouse movements, key presses, etc. Our example moves the <code>(x,y)</code> coordinate around based on the arrow keys.</li><li><code>view</code> - Turn the memory into a picture. Our example just shows one blue square at the <code>(x,y)</code> coordinate we have been tracking in memory.</li></ol><p>When you start making fancier games, you will store fancier things in memory. There is a lot of room to develop your programming skills here: Making lists, using records, creating custom types, etc.</p><p>I started off trying to make Pong, then worked on games like Breakout and Space Invaders as I learned more and more. It was really fun, and I hope it will be for you as well!</p><h3 id="index"><a href="#index" class="anchor"></a>Index of modules</h3><ul class="modules"><li><a href="Playground/index.html"><code>Playground</code></a> </li><li><a href="Playground_platform/index.html"><code>Playground_platform</code></a> </li></ul></div></body></html>
