# OCaml Elm Playground

Create pictures, animations, and games with OCaml!

This is a port of the excellent Elm playground package
https://github.com/evancz/elm-playground to OCaml.

This is the package I wanted when I was learning programming. Start by
putting shapes on screen and work up to making games. I hope this
package will be fun for a broad range of ages and backgrounds!

For more information see the package documentation at: TODO URL
